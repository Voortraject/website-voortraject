# Todo

Planning & progress tracking for the Voortraject website. One section per task/change.

## Project bootstrap (2026-06-23)

- [x] Adapt `CLAUDE.md` from the CRM repo to the website
- [x] Create `.claudeignore`, `tasks/todo.md`, `tasks/lessons.md`
- [x] Connect the GitHub repo — cloned `Voortraject/website-voortraject` (default branch `main`)
- [x] Confirm against the code and update `CLAUDE.md`:
  - [x] Package manager → **bun** (`bun.lockb`, `bunx` in scripts)
  - [x] Supabase: **two** projects — own `zvsmazjcfzjyvnjrlnma` (`client.ts`) +
        CRM `lfelnfukbrxznkevnevr` (`external-client.ts`, `supabaseExternal`)
  - [x] File paths: `src/integrations/supabase/{client,external-client,types}.ts`
  - [x] Color palette from `src/index.css` (ink blue / mustard / off-white / sand)
- [ ] Commit the scaffold (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claudeignore`, `tasks/`) via a branch + PR
- [ ] **Decide on the committed `.env`** (see Review note) — values are public anon/
      publishable keys, but `.env` should be gitignored going forward

### Review (2026-06-23)
- GitHub is connected via clone into `c:\dev\website-voortraject`; working on `main`.
- Stack confirmed: React 18 + Vite + TS + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, bun, vitest.
- Two Supabase connections confirmed (own project + external CRM project).
- **Security note (low severity, worth fixing):** `.env` is committed to this *public*
  repo and is **not** in `.gitignore`. The values are the Supabase URL + *publishable/anon*
  key, which are public by design (they ship to the browser anyway), so this is not a
  breach. The real risk is forward-looking: if anyone ever adds a true secret (e.g. a
  `service_role` key) to `.env`, it would leak. Recommended: add `.env` to `.gitignore` and
  stop tracking it (`git rm --cached .env`). Do this via a branch + PR, and confirm it
  won't break the Lovable/Cloudflare build first.
