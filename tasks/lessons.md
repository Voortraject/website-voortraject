## 2026-06-24 — Footer oker glow: match the reference, treat sections as one whole, apply site-wide
**Context:** Asked to add a De Duurzame Jongens–style warm oker glow behind the footer. Took
several iterations: (1) a subtle drifting gradient was "too vague"; (2) two stacked sections
(closing CTA + Footer) each with their own glow showed a visible seam; (3) switching to many
small pulsing "lamp" blobs was wrong — the reference is one large, smooth gradient that slowly
drifts; (4) the "one whole" fix was only applied to the homepage, not every page.
**Lesson:**
- When a visual reference is given, match its *character* exactly (here: one big soft warm wash
  that orbits, NOT many small blobs). Study all the example images before choosing a technique.
- "Two sections as one whole" means a single shared dark container + one glow layer spanning
  both — not two adjacent boxes each styled the same. Separate `overflow-hidden` boxes always
  seam.
- Closing CTA + Footer pattern repeats on nearly every page (homepage `ClosingCta`, inline dark
  CTAs on Bewoners/Uitvoerders/OverOns/Subsidies*, and the shared `MaatregelPagina` template).
  A footer change like this must be rolled out everywhere, not just the page being previewed.
- Implementation that worked: `Footer` takes a `cta?: ReactNode`, renders it inside its own
  `bg-primary` + `.ambient-glow` container; each page moves its closing CTA `<section>` into the
  `cta` prop and drops the section's own dark background.
